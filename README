Linux demo kit

A set of sample code and libraries for developing demoscene productions in Linux.

To use, you will need a C/C++ compiler like GCC, and GNU make. Some samples also
use pthreads for multithreading.

These samples were coded around i686 and x86_64 targets, but theoretically should
be usable on almost any processor.
